the goal is to sort in ascending order numbers into stack a

to do so I had a few operations at my disposal

I chose for implementing the radix sorting algorithm for which I used bitwise operations


UTILISATION
------------

run 'make' to compile

run './push_swap randomnumbersseperatedwithspaces'

ex. './push_swap -2 4 -345 20 17 82 5'
